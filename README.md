# Cribbage_Proofs

I was told that if you throw any combination of a five (One/Four, Two/Three, Five), that it results in getting points.
This is both a simple proof to myself that this is a true statement, and as well it provides a set of classes that I plan to use later on, the most useful being the ability to count points from cibbage hands. 
I've also added a quick method to calculate the percentage of cribs/hands that result in have no points. 

The rules that I used to calculate points
